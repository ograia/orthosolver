# Lean 4 Skills

Lean 4 workflow pack for AI coding agents. Gives your agent a structured
prove/review/golf loop, mathlib search, axiom checking, and safety guardrails.
The workflows are host-agnostic — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and
others all use the same core skill; only the invocation surface differs.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Description |
|---|---|
| formalize | Turn informal math into Lean statements |
| prove | Guided cycle-by-cycle theorem proving |
| autoprove | Autonomous multi-cycle proving with stop rules |
| checkpoint | Verified save point (build + axiom check + commit) |
| review | Read-only quality review |
| golf | Optimize proofs for brevity |
| learn | Interactive teaching and mathlib exploration |
| doctor | Diagnostics and migration help |

**Claude Code:** invoke as `/lean4:<name>`. **Other hosts:** follow the corresponding workflow in [SKILL.md](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/SKILL.md).

Typical session: `prove` (or `autoprove`) → `review` → `golf` → `checkpoint` → `git push`.

## How It Works

- **`prove`** — Guided, interactive. Asks preferences at startup, prompts before each commit, pauses between cycles. Start here.
- **`autoprove`** — Autonomous, unattended. Auto-commits, loops until a stop condition fires (max cycles, max time, or stuck).
- Both share one cycle engine: **Plan → Work → Checkpoint → Review → Replan → Continue/Stop**. Each sorry gets a mathlib search, tactic attempts, and validation. `--commit` controls per-fill commit behavior. When stuck, both force a review + replan.
- Editing `.lean` files without a command activates the skill for one bounded pass — fix the immediate issue, then suggest `prove` or `autoprove` for more.

See [plugin README](plugins/lean4/README.md) for the full command guide.

## Lean LSP MCP Server (Highly Recommended)

[lean-lsp-mcp](https://github.com/oOo0oOo/lean-lsp-mcp) provides **sub-second
feedback** instead of 30+ second `lake build` cycles. Works with any MCP-capable host.

**What you get:**
- `lean_goal` — exact goal state at any line
- `lean_local_search` / `lean_leanfinder` / `lean_leansearch` / `lean_loogle` — mathlib search
- `lean_multi_attempt` — test multiple tactics in parallel
- `lean_hammer_premise` — premise suggestions for simp/aesop/grind

**Claude Code** (run from your Lean project root):
```bash
claude mcp add lean-lsp uvx lean-lsp-mcp
```

**Other hosts:** See [INSTALLATION.md → MCP Server](INSTALLATION.md#lean-lsp-mcp-server-all-hosts)

## Installation

### Claude Code (native plugin)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add cameronfreer/lean4-skills
/plugin install lean4
```

### Other Hosts

Clone (shallow) and follow the setup for your host:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-skills.git
```

- **Codex CLI** — add to `AGENTS.md` + env vars. See [INSTALLATION.md → Codex](INSTALLATION.md#openai-codex-cli)
- **Gemini CLI** — add to `GEMINI.md` + env vars. See [INSTALLATION.md → Gemini](INSTALLATION.md#gemini-cli)
- **Cursor** — project rules → SKILL.md + env vars. See [INSTALLATION.md → Cursor](INSTALLATION.md#cursor)
- **Windsurf** — project rules → SKILL.md + env vars. See [INSTALLATION.md → Windsurf](INSTALLATION.md#windsurf)
- **OpenCode** — copy to `.opencode/skills/` + env vars. See [INSTALLATION.md → OpenCode](INSTALLATION.md#opencode)
- **Other agents** — point agent at SKILL.md + env vars. See [INSTALLATION.md → Generic](INSTALLATION.md#any-agent-generic)

## Compatibility

| Host | Status | Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Full native | SKILL.md + scripts + `/lean4:*` commands, hooks, guardrails, subagents |
| Codex / Gemini / OpenCode | Documented\* | SKILL.md + scripts |
| Cursor / Windsurf | Documented\* | Project rules → SKILL.md + scripts |

\*Documented setup patterns, not CI-verified.
