# Cycle Engine Reference

> Shared logic for `/lean4:prove` and `/lean4:autoprove`.

Both commands share a six-phase cycle engine. This reference documents the shared mechanics; command-specific behavior is noted inline.

## Six-Phase Cycle

```
Plan → Work → Checkpoint → Review → Replan → Continue/Stop
```

1. **Plan** — Discover state via LSP, identify sorries, set order
2. **Work** — Fill sorries using search + tactics (see [sorry-filling.md](sorry-filling.md))
3. **Checkpoint** — Stage and commit progress
4. **Review** — Quality check at configured intervals
5. **Replan** — Enter planner mode, produce/update action plan
6. **Continue/Stop** — prove: prompt user; autoprove: auto-continue or stop

## LSP-First Protocol

LSP tools are the normative first-pass for all discovery, search, and validation. Script fallback is permitted only when LSP is unavailable or its budget is exhausted.

**Planning phase (per target sorry):**
1. `lean_goal(file, line)` — understand goal before ordering
2. Up to 3 LSP search tools (time-boxed ~30s total): `lean_local_search`, preferably `lean_leanfinder` for semantic/goal-aware search (`lean_leansearch` for natural-language fallback, `lean_hammer_premise` for premise suggestions), and `lean_loogle` for type-pattern gaps
3. Record top candidate lemmas and intended next attempts in the plan
4. **Trivial-goal shortcut:** If the goal is obviously solvable (`rfl`, `simp`, `exact` with a known lemma), skip extended search — proceed directly to work phase

**Work phase (per sorry):**
1. Refresh `lean_goal(file, line)` at start
2. Run up to 2 LSP search tools before any script fallback (skip if trivial goal or prior planning search was conclusive)
3. Generate 2-3 candidate proof snippets from search results. When `lean_hammer_premise` returns premises, generate `simp only [p1, p2]` and `grind [p1, p2]` candidates.
4. Test with `lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])`
5. Prefer shortest passing candidate; only then edit/commit

**Fallback gate:** Script fallback (`$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/smart_search.sh`, `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/search_mathlib.sh`) and repair agents are permitted when:
- LSP search budget is exhausted (at least 2 searches returning empty/inconclusive), OR
- LSP server is confirmed unavailable, timing out, or rate-limited

For sorry discovery fallback, prefer one-pass structured output:
`${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/sorry_analyzer.py" <target> --format=json --report-only`.
Use default `text` for quick human review and `summary` only for counts.
Do not suppress script stderr via `/dev/null`; surfaced errors are part of the fallback signal.

**Validation:** Use `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` for per-edit checks. Reserve `lake build` for checkpoint verification or explicit `/lean4:checkpoint`. See [Build Target Policy](#build-target-policy) for the full ladder.

## Build Target Policy

Three-tier verification ladder — use the lightest tool that answers the question:

| Tier | Tool | When | Speed |
|------|------|------|-------|
| Per-edit | `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` | After every edit | Sub-second |
| File compile | `lake env lean <path/to/File.lean>` | File-level gate, import checks | Seconds |
| Project gate | `lake build` | Checkpoint, final gate, `/lean4:checkpoint` | Minutes |

Run `lake env lean` from the Lean project root; pass repo-relative file paths.

**Never use `lake build <file basename>`** — `lake build` does not accept file path arguments. Use `lake env lean <path/to/File.lean>` for single-file compilation.

## Review Phase

At configured intervals (`--review-every`), run review matching current scope:
- Working on single sorry → `--scope=sorry --line=N`
- Working on file → `--scope=file`
- Never trigger `--scope=project` automatically

Reviews act as gates: review → replan → continue. In prove, replan requires user approval; in autoprove, replan auto-continues.

## Replan Phase

After review → enter planner mode → produce/update action plan. Work phase follows that plan next cycle.

## Stuck Definition

A sorry or repair target is **stuck** when any of these hold:

1. Same sorry failed 2-3 times with no new approach
2. Same build error repeats after 2 repair attempts
3. No sorry count decrease for 10+ minutes
4. LSP search returns empty twice for same goal

**Same blocker** is computed as `(file, line, primary_error_code_or_text_hash)`. Two consecutive iterations producing the same blocker signature = same blocker.

**When stuck detected:**

| Step | prove | autoprove |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 1. Review | `/lean4:review <file> --scope=sorry --line=N --mode=stuck` | Same |
| 2. Replan | Summarize findings, create fresh plan (3-6 steps) | Enter planner mode → revised plan |
| 3. Approval | Present for user approval: `[yes / no / skip]` | Auto-approve, next cycle executes plan |
| 4. On decline | Offer counterexample/salvage pass | N/A (autonomous) |

**Stuck handoff evidence:** When declaring a sorry stuck, include:
- LSP queries attempted (tool name + query text)
- Top candidate lemmas returned (if any)
- `lean_multi_attempt` outcomes (snippets tested, pass/fail for each)

**Important:** Stuck-triggered replan is mandatory even if `--planning=off`. It is a safety mechanism, not optional planning.

### Stuck → Counterexample / Salvage

When stuck and user declines the plan (prove) or review flags falsification (autoprove):

1. Explicit witness search (small domain or concrete instantiation)
2. If found → create `T_counterexample` lemma (see [Falsification Artifacts](#falsification-artifacts))
3. Create `T_salvaged` (weaker version that is provable)
4. **prove:** Follow user's falsification policy for original statement
5. **autoprove:** Follow default falsification policy (counterexample + salvage only)

## Deep Mode

Bounded subroutine for stubborn sorries. Allows multi-file refactoring, helper extraction, and statement generalization.

**Budget enforcement:**
- `--deep-sorry-budget` — max sorries per deep invocation
- `--deep-time-budget` — max time per deep invocation
- `--max-deep-per-cycle` — max deep invocations per cycle (default: 1)

If deep budget is exhausted with no progress → stuck.

| Feature | prove | autoprove |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `--deep=ask` | Prompt before each deep invocation | Not supported (coerced to `stuck`) |
| `--deep=stuck` | Auto-escalate when stuck | Auto-escalate when stuck (default) |
| `--deep=always` | Auto-escalate on any failure | Auto-escalate on any failure |
| `--deep=never` | No deep (default) | No deep |
| `--deep-sorry-budget` | 1 (default) | 2 (default) |
| `--deep-time-budget` | 10m (default) | 20m (default) |
| `--max-deep-per-cycle` | 1 | 1 |
| `--max-consecutive-deep-cycles` | N/A | 2 (autoprove-only) |
| `--deep-snapshot` | `stash` | `stash` | Pre-deep recovery (V1: `stash` only) |
| `--deep-rollback` | `on-regression` | `on-regression` | When to revert: `on-regression` / `on-no-improvement` / `always` / `never` |
| `--deep-scope` | `target` | `target` | Scope fence: `target` (sorry's file only) / `cross-file` |
| `--deep-max-files` | 1 | 2 | Max files deep may edit per invocation |
| `--deep-max-lines` | 120 | 200 | Max added+deleted lines per deep invocation |
| `--deep-regression-gate` | `strict` | `strict` | `strict`: auto-abort on regression; `off`: log only |
| Statement changes | Interactive approval prompt | Logged but auto-skipped |
| `--commit=ask` | Per-commit prompt (yes/yes-all/no/never) | Coerced to `auto` at startup |

### Deep Safety Definitions

- **Regression**: sorry count increases, new diagnostic errors appear, or new blocker signatures introduced compared to pre-deep snapshot
- **No improvement**: sorry count unchanged AND no diagnostic improvement after deep completes
- **Rollback**: restore working tree to pre-deep snapshot via saved snapshot id/ref; mark sorry as stuck with reason (e.g., `"deep: regression — sorry count increased from 3 to 5"`)

### Deep Snapshot and Rollback

Before entering deep mode, the engine captures a **path-scoped** snapshot of all files in the deep scope (target file when `--deep-scope=target`; declared files when `--deep-scope=cross-file`). Only deep-managed paths are snapshotted — unrelated working-tree edits are not swept in.

The snapshot mechanism is implementation-defined; the contract is that rollback restores the snapshotted files to their exact pre-deep state without affecting other files.

Example (illustrative, not contractual):
```text
# Snapshot: <snapshot-create-command>(deep-managed-files, label="deep-snapshot: <sorry-id>") → <snapshot-id>
# Rollback: <snapshot-restore-command>(<snapshot-id>) → files restored, snapshot discarded
```

**Rollback triggers** (per `--deep-rollback`):

| `--deep-rollback` | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `on-regression` (default) | Regression detected |
| `on-no-improvement` | Regression OR no improvement |
| `always` | After every deep invocation (test-only) |
| `never` | Never rollback (prove only — coerced in autoprove) |

**On rollback:** restore snapshotted files to pre-deep state, mark sorry as stuck with reason `"deep: <trigger> — <detail>"`. If rollback itself fails (e.g., conflict), stop the current cycle immediately, mark sorry as stuck with `"deep: rollback failed"`, and skip checkpoint for this cycle. Stuck handoff must include the abort reason.

### Deep Scope Fence

`--deep-scope` controls which files deep may touch:

| `--deep-scope` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `target` (default) | Only the file containing the target sorry |
| `cross-file` | Multi-file refactoring, helper extraction |

If deep edits exceed `--deep-max-files` or `--deep-max-lines`, the engine triggers immediate rollback and marks stuck with reason `"deep: scope exceeded — N files / M lines"`.

### Deep Regression Gate

When `--deep-regression-gate=strict` (default): after each deep phase, the engine compares diagnostics against the pre-deep baseline.

**File set (identical for baseline and comparison):** the target file when `--deep-scope=target`; all files declared in the deep plan when `--deep-scope=cross-file`. This is the same set used for the path-scoped snapshot.

**Baseline:** `lean_diagnostic_messages` output for all files in the set, captured immediately before the first deep edit.

**Comparison:** re-run `lean_diagnostic_messages` on the same file set and compare:

1. Sorry count increased → rollback + stuck (`"deep: regression — sorry count +N"`)
2. New diagnostic errors appeared (error not present in baseline) → rollback + stuck (`"deep: regression — new errors"`)
3. New blocker signatures introduced (see [Stuck Definition](#stuck-definition)) → rollback + stuck (`"deep: regression — new blockers"`)

When `off`: regressions are logged but do not trigger rollback. Only available in prove (coerced to `strict` in autoprove).

### Deep Safety Coercions (autoprove)

| Flag | Coerced from | Coerced to | Warning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--deep-rollback` | `never` | `on-regression` | "deep-rollback=never disables safety rollback. Using on-regression for unattended operation." |
| `--deep-regression-gate` | `off` | `strict` | "deep-regression-gate=off allows regressions. Using strict for unattended operation." |

## Checkpoint Logic

If `--commit=never`, skip the checkpoint commit entirely — changes remain in the working tree.

Otherwise, if `--checkpoint` is enabled and there is a non-empty diff:
- **prove:** Stage only files from **accepted** fills (exclude declined fills)
- **autoprove:** Stage only files from successful, non-rolled-back work
- **Both:** Exclude files from rolled-back deep invocations — those files are restored to pre-deep state and must not be staged
- Commit: `git commit -m "checkpoint(lean4): [summary]"`

If no files changed during this cycle, emit:
> No changes this cycle — skipping checkpoint

Do NOT create an empty commit. Checkpoint requires a non-empty diff.

## Falsification Artifacts

**Counterexample lemma (preferred):**
```lean
/-- Counterexample to the naive statement `T`. -/
theorem T_counterexample : ∃ w : α, ¬ P w := by
  refine ⟨w0, ?_⟩
  -- proof
```

**Salvage lemma:**
```lean
/-- Salvage: a weaker version of `T` that is true. -/
theorem T_salvaged (extra_assumptions...) : Q := by
  -- proof
```

**Safety:** Avoid proving `¬ P` if a `theorem T : P := by sorry` exists — unless user explicitly chose negation policy.

## Repair Mode

Compiler-guided repair is an **escalation-only** workflow — not the default response to a first failure. Invoke only when compiler errors are the active blocker and LSP-first tactics cannot resolve them.

**Trigger conditions** (any one sufficient):
- Same blocker signature repeats 2 consecutive iterations
- Same build error repeats after 2 repair attempts
- 3 or more distinct compiler errors active in scope simultaneously

**Direct-fix-first rule:** For straightforward single errors (missing import, obvious coercion, local instance, simple typo), apply the fix directly. Escalate to the repair agent only if the direct fix fails or the error recurs.

**Budgets:**

| Parameter | prove | autoprove |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Max repair attempts per error signature per cycle | 2 | 2 |
| Max total repair attempts per cycle | 6 | 8 |

**Improvement definition:** Error count in scope decreases OR the current blocker signature disappears. A repair attempt that changes errors without reducing count is neutral (counts toward budget but does not reset it).

**No-improvement rule:** If 2 consecutive repair attempts on the same signature produce no improvement → target is **stuck**. Force review + replan (see [Stuck Definition](#stuck-definition)).

| Behavior | prove | autoprove |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Interactive repair prompts | Ask user for guidance | Coerced to autonomous: auto-select next strategy |
| On stuck after repair | Present plan for approval | Auto-replan, next cycle executes |

**Error quick-reference:**

| Error | Typical Fix |
|-------|-------------|
| `type mismatch` | Add coercion, `convert`, fix argument |
| `unknown identifier` | Search mathlib, add import |
| `failed to synthesize` | Add `haveI`/`letI` |
| `timeout` | Narrow `simp`, add explicit types |

## Safety

Blocked git commands (both prove and autoprove):
- `git push` (review first)
- `git commit --amend` (preserve history)
- `gh pr create` (review first)
- `git checkout --`/`git restore`/`git reset --hard`/`git clean` (use `git stash push -u` or revert commit)
