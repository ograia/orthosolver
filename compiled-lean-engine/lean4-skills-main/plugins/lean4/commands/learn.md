## Inputs

| Arg | Required | Default | Description |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| topic | no | — | Free-text topic, theorem name, file path, or natural-language claim. If omitted, start conversational discovery; set `--mode` after first user reply. |
| --mode | no | `auto` | `auto` \| `repo` \| `mathlib` |
| --level | no | `intermediate` | `beginner` \| `intermediate` \| `expert` |
| --scope | no | `auto` | `auto` \| `file` \| `changed` \| `project` \| `topic` |
| --style | no | `tour` | `tour` \| `socratic` \| `exercise` \| `game` |
| --output | no | `chat` | `chat` \| `scratch` \| `file` |
| --out | no | — | Output path. Required when `--output=file`; hard error if missing. |
| --overwrite | no | `false` | Allow overwriting existing files with `--output=file`. Without flag, existing target → hard error. |
| --interactive | no | `false` | True Socratic method (withhold answers, ask questions). Valid only with `--style=socratic`; ignored with warning otherwise. |
| --intent | no | `auto` | `auto` \| `usage` \| `internals` \| `authoring` \| `math`. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#intent-taxonomy). |
| --presentation | no | `auto` | `informal` \| `supporting` \| `formal` \| `auto`. Controls user-facing display, not Lean backing. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#two-layer-architecture). |
| --verify | no | `best-effort` | `best-effort` \| `strict`. Verification strictness for key claims. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#verification-status). |
| --track | no | — | Exercise ladder: `nng-like` \| `set-theory-like` \| `analysis-like` \| `proofs-reintro`. Valid only with `--style=game`. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#track-ladders). |
| --source | no | — | File path, URL, or PDF to seed learning. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#source-handling). |

### Scope defaults by mode (when `--scope=auto`)

| Mode | Default scope |
|------|--------------|
| `repo` | `file` |
| `mathlib` | `topic` |
### Scope coercions

- `--mode=mathlib` + `--scope=file|changed|project` → warn + coerce to `topic`, unless topic resolves to a local declaration

### Output validation

- `--output=file` without `--out` → hard error
- `--output=scratch` → `.scratch/lean4/learn-<timestamp>.lean` (workspace-local). Auto-create `.scratch/lean4/` if missing; warn if `.scratch/` is not in `.gitignore`.
- `--output=file` with existing target and no `--overwrite` → hard error

### Flag validation

- `--intent`, `--presentation`, or `--verify` with invalid value → hard error.
- `--track` without `--style=game` → warn + ignore. `--style=game` without `--track` → prompt track picker.
- `--source` + `--scope=file|changed|project` → warn "source overrides scope for initial discovery". Unsupported source type → warn + ask for text excerpt.

## Actions

### 0. Intent Intake

**Two-layer contract:** All modes are Lean-backed by default. Lean verification is attempted for all key claims — theorem statements, correctness judgments, game pass/fail, and "therefore X" assertions. `--presentation` controls what is shown, not whether Lean runs. Each key-claim step carries a verification label: `[verified]`, `[partially-verified]`, or `[unverified]`. Under `--verify=strict`, never present claims as settled unless verified; on failure after retry, mark blocked and offer: continue conceptually or relax to `best-effort`. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#two-layer-architecture).

Classify learning intent and establish a session Learning Profile: {intent, presentation, verify, style, track, level}. `--source` is per-invocation only (not persisted) unless user explicitly says "continue same source." Explicit flags are used directly; inference is only for `auto` values. **Announce** resolved intent and presentation, marking each as inferred or explicit. When `--presentation=auto`: if confidence is high, auto-resolve and announce; if ambiguous, ask: "Informal (prose, Lean-backed), supporting (prose + Lean snippets), or formal (Lean shown)?" Profile persists within the current conversation; explicit flags on later turns override and update it. Precedence (applied before validation rules): explicit flags > stored profile > inference. If explicit `--intent` conflicts with source-inferred intent, honor explicit and warn about mismatch. If explicit `--mode` conflicts with resolved intent (explicit or inferred), honor explicit mode and warn. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#intent-behavior-matrix) for inference rules and the full behavior matrix.

### 1. Mode Resolution

When `--mode=auto`, resolve by tie-breaking order:

1. If topic resolves to an existing `.lean` file path → `repo`
2. Resolve topic against project-local declarations (via `Grep`/`$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_usages.sh`). **Local wins** — if both local and mathlib match, prefer local → `repo`
3. Check mathlib namespace/theorem names (via `lean_local_search`, `lean_leanfinder`/`lean_leansearch`, `lean_loogle`) → `mathlib`
4. If topic is a natural-language mathematical statement → suggest `/lean4:formalize`
5. If ambiguous → ask the user

When no topic is provided, enter conversational discovery and set `--mode` after the user's first reply.

**Intent bias:** After tie-breaking, cross-check against intent. `--intent=math` biases toward `/lean4:formalize` — suggest it, do not enter formalize mode. `--intent=internals` biases toward `repo`. If bias conflicts with tie-breaking and no explicit `--mode`, ask the user.

### 2. Discovery (per mode)

**repo:** `Glob`/`Grep` (file survey) → `Read` (targeted content) → `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_usages.sh` (dependency pass). Build a map: key files, declarations, dependency flow, where proofs live.

**mathlib:** `lean_local_search` → one semantic search (`lean_leanfinder` for goal/proof-state shaped queries, `lean_leansearch` for natural-language concept queries) → `lean_loogle` (type-pattern gaps). Present canonical lemmas, type signatures, minimal usage examples.

**Source-aware:** When `--source` is provided, ingest first: `.lean` → `Read`; PDF → `Read` (for large PDFs, read abstract/intro/theorems first, ask which section); `.md`/`.txt` → `Read` directly; URL → web fetch (if unavailable, ask user for excerpt); other types → warn + ask for text excerpt. Extract key definitions, theorem statements, notation. Use as seed for the resolved mode's discovery. On ingestion failure: ask user for relevant excerpt and proceed.

**Fallback rule:** If a tool is unavailable or rate-limited, continue with the next tool in order, label affected output `[unverified]` or `[partially-verified]`, and note the fallback. If Lean verification fails after retry: attempt to revise; if revision also fails, state that verification is pending/failed and offer: continue conceptually or switch to formal mode.

### 3. Explanation

Present findings at the user's `--level` in the user's `--style`:

- **tour:** Narrated walkthrough, explains as it goes.
- **socratic:** Guided discovery with prompts. If `--interactive`, withhold answers and ask user questions first — delay direct solutions until user has engaged.
- **exercise:** Present a challenge, let user attempt, then explain. Always end with a Lean-verified reference solution.
- **game:** Structured progression through `--track` levels. Verification is always Lean-backed (`lean_goal` + `lean_multi_attempt` + clean `lean_diagnostic_messages`). In `informal`: user argues informally; agent restates its interpretation before checking, reports result without showing Lean unless asked. In `supporting`: user argues informally; agent shows the Lean translation after verification. In `formal`: user writes Lean proofs directly. If no `--track`, present track picker. See [learn-pathways.md](../skills/lean4/references/learn-pathways.md#game-style).

### 4. Depth Check

Offer the depth-check menu:

- show source / show proof state / show alternative approach
- **show Lean backing** (on-demand transparency into the verification layer)
- go deeper / switch mode / broaden scope
- **formalize a specific result** → suggest `/lean4:formalize`
- **save to scratch** / **write to file** (mid-session output actions — `--output` is part of the loop, not just startup config)

### 5. Iterate

Return to step 2 with refined scope based on user's choice. Continue until the user is satisfied or switches mode.

## Output

Output format follows `--presentation`: `informal` → prose with math notation (no Lean blocks unless user requests "show Lean backing"); `supporting` → prose with selective Lean snippets; `formal` → Lean code blocks as primary content. In `scratch` or `file` mode, additionally write a `.lean` file regardless of presentation.

## Safety

- **Read-only by default.** `repo` and `mathlib` modes never write files unless `--output` requests it.
- **No silent mutations.** Prefer LSP tools (`lean_goal`) over file writes for compilation checks. If LSP unavailable and temp file needed for internal compilation, write only under `/tmp/lean4-learn/`, auto-cleanup after use, warn user before writing.
- **No commits.** `/learn` never commits. `--output=file` writes but does not stage or commit.
- **Path restriction.** User-requested outputs (`--output=file`, `--output=scratch`) restricted to workspace root (scratch uses `.scratch/lean4/`). Reject path traversal (`../`) or absolute paths outside workspace. Internal temp files may use `/tmp/lean4-learn/`.
- **Overwrite protection.** `--output=file` with existing target requires `--overwrite`; otherwise hard error.
- **Scope guardrails.** `--scope=project` in repo mode with >50 `.lean` files → warn with count, ask to narrow. In non-interactive contexts (e.g., LLM-invoked), default to "no" (do not proceed with large scope).
- **All `guardrails.sh` rules apply.**
