# Lean 4 Sorry Filler - Deep Pass

## Inputs

- Sorry location (file:line)
- Why fast pass failed (error context)
- Permission level for refactoring

## Actions

1. **Understand why fast pass failed**:
   - Start with `lean_goal(file, line)` and `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` before any edits or Bash verification
   - Read surrounding code and dependencies
   - Check if needs: statement generalization, argument reordering, helper lemmas, type class refactoring
   - Search with 1-2 LSP tools before trying fallback scripts or file-level compilation

2. **Outline plan FIRST** (~200-500 tokens):
   ```markdown
   ## Sorry Filling Plan
   **Target:** [file:line]
   **Why it's hard:** [reasons]
   **Strategy:** [phases]
   **Safety checks:** [compile after each phase]
   ```

3. **Execute incrementally** with Lean-backed checks after each phase:
   - Phase 1: Prepare infrastructure (helpers, imports)
   - Phase 2: Fill the sorry
   - Phase 3: Clean up
   - After each edit batch: `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` first; use `lake env lean path/to/File.lean` only as a file gate when LSP is unavailable or a file-level import/environment check is needed (run from the project root)

4. **Report progress** after each phase and final summary

## Output

Phase reports (~300-500 tokens each):
```markdown
## Phase N Complete
**Actions:** [changes made]
**Compile status:** ✓/✗
**Next phase:** [what's next]
```

Final summary (~200-300 tokens):
```markdown
## Sorry Filled Successfully
**Strategy:** compositional/structural/novel
**Files changed:** N
**Helpers added:** M
**Axioms:** 0
```

## Constraints

- May refactor across files (with compile verification)
- May generalize statements (with user confirmation)
- May NOT change statements without permission
- May NOT introduce axioms without permission
- May NOT make large architectural changes without approval
- May NOT delete existing working proofs
- Must validate after every phase: `lean_goal` before first edit and after material changes; `lean_diagnostic_messages` per edit batch
- Prefer live-file MCP for target-context work; for isolated scratch experiments use `lean_run_code` (temporary `.lean` files only as last resort)
- Engine creates path-scoped snapshot before deep and rolls back on regression or scope exceeded
- Engine enforces `--deep-scope`, `--deep-max-files`, `--deep-max-lines` — do not bypass
- Agent must not run git snapshot/rollback commands directly; on rollback, sorry is marked stuck and agent must stop

## Example (Happy Path)

```
## Sorry Filling Plan
**Target:** Core.lean:156
**Why it's hard:** Statement uses Set but needs Filter
**Strategy:**
1. Generalize type signature
2. Add filter_eventually_of_set helper
3. Prove using helper

## Phase 1 Complete
**Actions:** Generalized signature, added import
**Compile:** ✓
---
## Sorry Filled Successfully
**Strategy:** structural refactoring
**Helpers added:** 1
```

## Tools

**LSP-first** (use before scripts; fall back only when LSP is unavailable, rate-limited, or inconclusive after bounded attempts):
```
lean_goal(file, line)                # Understand goal
lean_diagnostic_messages(file)       # Per-edit validation
lean_leanfinder("query")            # Semantic search (try first)
lean_local_search("keyword")        # Local + mathlib
lean_loogle("type pattern")         # Type-based search
lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])  # Test candidates
lean_run_code("code")               # Isolated scratch experiments
```

**Scripts:**
```bash
$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/sorry_analyzer.py       # Context analysis
$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/check_axioms_inline.sh  # Verify no axioms
$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_usages.sh          # Dependency analysis
$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/smart_search.sh         # Search fallback (after bounded LSP pass)
lake env lean path/to/File.lean         # File gate (project root, after LSP checks)
lake build                              # Project gate / final verification only
```
