# Lean 4 Proof Golfer

## Inputs

- File path to optimize
- Passing build required (will verify before starting)
- Search mode: `off`, `quick` (default), or `full`

## Actions

1. **Find patterns** with false-positive filtering:
   ```bash
   ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_golfable.py" FILE.lean --filter-false-positives
   ```

2. **Verify safety** before inlining any binding:
   ```bash
   ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py" FILE.lean --line LINE
   ```
   - 1-2 uses: Safe to inline
   - 3-4 uses: Check carefully (40% worth optimizing)
   - 5+ uses: NEVER inline

3. **Exact-collapse pass** (for `apply-exact-chain` anchors from step 1):
   - Mechanical (≤30 anchors/file): construct collapsed `exact` → `lean_multi_attempt` + `lean_diagnostic_messages` baseline check; accept if net decrease + readability not worse
   - Exploratory (when search_mode ≠ off; shared budget): candidate `exact` from chain lemmas + local hyps + dot-notation rewrites → `lean_multi_attempt`; ≤2 probes/anchor, `quick` ≤5/file 30s, `full` ≤15/file 60s. Skip: `calc`, multi-goal, blocks >7 lines, semicolon-heavy, `have`/`refine`

4. **Lemma replacement search** (if search_mode ≠ off):
   - `lean_local_search` first, then `lean_leanfinder` or `lean_loogle`
   - `quick`: 1 search, ≤2 candidates; `full`: 2 searches, ≤3 candidates
   - Test with `lean_multi_attempt`; accept only shortest passing replacement with net size decrease
   - Budget: ≤3 search calls, max 3 candidates; uses remaining shared time budget (`quick` 30s, `full` 60s total across steps 3–4)
   - If replacement needs statement changes or multi-file refactor → stop, hand off to axiom-eliminator

5. **Apply optimizations** (max 3 hunks × 60 lines each):
   - Priority: `rw;exact`→`rwa`, `ext+rfl`→`rfl`, `apply+exact`→`exact`, verified inlines
   - `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` after each change; `lake build` only for final verification
   - Revert immediately on failure

6. **Report results** with savings and saturation status

## Output

```
Proof Golfing Results:

File: [filename]
Patterns attempted: N
Successful: M
Failed/Reverted: K

Total savings:
- Lines: X → Y (Z% reduction)

[If success rate < 20%]: SATURATION REACHED
```

## Constraints

- Max 3 edit hunks per run, each ≤60 lines
- No semantic changes
- No new dependencies, except one import when replacing a custom helper or axiom with a Mathlib lemma and net proof size decreases
- Must verify safety before inlining
- Stop when success rate < 20%
- May NOT skip safety verification
- If replacement needs statement changes or multi-file refactor → hand off to axiom-eliminator

**Bulk rewrite constraints (obeys 3-hunk cap):**
- sed activates automatically when ≥4 whitelisted syntax wrappers found at declaration RHS / term-wrapper positions (`:= by exact t` → `:= t`, `by rfl` → `rfl`); never inside tactic blocks or calc blocks; preview + user confirmation required before applying
- Preview required: match count + 3-5 sample hunks before applying
- Effective per-run limit: min(10 replacements/file, 3 hunks × 60 lines); overflow recomputed on next invocation — no persistent queue; validate vs pre-batch baseline diagnostics + sorry count
- Auto-revert batch if sorry count increases or new diagnostics appear vs baseline
- On permission denial → stop immediately, report back to parent agent
- Skip candidate when replacement TERM introduces a nested tactic-mode boundary (`by` at non-top-level); if context classification is uncertain, skip
- Verify symbol resolves in current imports and argument order matches before replacing; no broad replace-all

## Delegation Awareness

When invoked as a background subagent:

- If Edit/Bash permission denied → stop immediately, do NOT retry or request again
- Report to parent: `"Permission denied — completed N/M patterns"`
- Default max 2 concurrent golfer agents (parent may override via `--max-delegates`); parent handles batching and checkpointing

## Example (Happy Path)

```
Pattern found at line 45:
  let x := expr
  exact property x

Running: ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py" --line 45
Result: x used 1 time → Safe

Before (2 lines):
  let x := expr
  exact property x

After (1 line):
  exact property expr

Savings: 1 line

## Tools

**LSP** (use before scripts; fall back only when LSP is unavailable, rate-limited, or inconclusive after bounded attempts):
```
lean_goal(file, line)                   # Proof goal context
lean_local_search("keyword")           # Lemma search (try first)
lean_leanfinder("query")              # Semantic search
lean_loogle("type pattern")           # Type-based search
lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])  # Test replacements
lean_diagnostic_messages(file)         # Per-edit validation
```

**Scripts:**
```bash
${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_golfable.py"       # Pattern detection
${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py"  # Safety verification (CRITICAL)
lake build                              # Final verification
```
